# Time-Hop Prototype

## Overview
This is a simple prototype of the game concept "Time-Hop", developed using Python and Pygame. 
The game features a player character that can switch between different time epochs to avoid obstacles.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pygame

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

### Step 2: Install Python
If you don't have Python installed, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Step 3: Install Pygame
Open your terminal and run the following command to install Pygame.

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## How to Play

### Controls
- Move the player left: **Left Arrow Key**
- Move the player right: **Right Arrow Key**
- Switch time epochs: **Space Bar**

### Gameplay
1. **Movement:** You control a red square (representing the player) that moves horizontally based on which arrow key you press.
2. **Time Epochs:** The game has two time epochs that you can toggle between by pressing the space bar. The background color changes to indicate which time epoch you are in (white for the past, black for the future).
3. **Obstacles:** There are blue squares (obstacles) that are also tied to a time epoch. You can only see them when you are in the same time epoch.
4. **Objective:** In this simple prototype, there's no specific objective; it's more to demonstrate the mechanic of switching between time epochs and avoiding obstacles.

Enjoy the game!
